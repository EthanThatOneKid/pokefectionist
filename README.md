# Pokéfectionist 🌟

> A perfectionist's tool for Pokémon collecting

## Check out a [demo][example]! 👀

## How to use? 💾

If you would like to utilize this program, download this repository and run the executable.
Have fun!

## What's going on here? ❓

This is a program written in [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) in the [QB64 IDE](https://www.qb64.org/portal/).
It has a text-based interface where you can add and delete Pokémon to your collection.
Upon running the program, you will receive two options: add and delete.
After you choose add/delete, you must enter a valid Pokédex number and the program will save that you have added/deleted that Pokémon from your collection.
After that, you can go into the output directory of this project and you will find a file called `pokefectionist.html` (See the [example][example]).
When you open it in your browser of choice, it shows your completion by having all the Pokémon you have collected highlighted in green.
You can refresh that page to see any updates made via the desktop program. ✌

## Origin 🧙‍♂️
I originally created this program to help myself with a life-long project to complete a binder of Pokémon cards with one of each Pokémon. A page from the binder is composed of 3x3 card sleeves; meaning 9 cards per page. I created this program that simultaneously saves my current list of Pokémon that I have obtained and outputs an html file that allows me to visually comprehend my completion in a way that mimics the format of the binder.
